Here are links to some of my projects:

* [FOSS4Spectroscopy](https://bryanhanson.github.io/FOSS4Spectroscopy/) is a listing of free and open source (FOSS) software resources for spectroscopy.  Most of the entries are packages for `R` and `Python`.
* [ChemoSpec](https://bryanhanson.github.io/ChemoSpec/)  is an `R` package for exploratory data analysis of one dimensional spectroscopic data sets such as IR, NMR, and Raman spectra.
* [ChemoSpec2D](https://bryanhanson.github.io/ChemoSpec2D/) is an `R` package for exploratory data analysis of two dimensional NMR data sets.
* [readJDX](https://github.com/bryanhanson/readJDX) is an `R` package for reading files in the JCAMP-DX format.
* [exCon](https://github.com/bryanhanson/exCon) is an `R` package which creates an interactive web page to explore topographic-like data sets. Such data is found in cartography, 2D spectroscopy and chemometrics.  [Demo](http://bryanhanson.github.io/exCon/exCon.html)
* [SpecHelpers](https://github.com/bryanhanson/SpecHelpers) is an `R` package with a number of spectroscopy-related utilities.
