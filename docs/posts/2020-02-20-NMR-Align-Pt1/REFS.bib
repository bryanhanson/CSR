abstract = {Metabolic phenotyping is an important tool in translational biomedical research. The advanced analytical technologies commonly used for phenotyping, including mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, generate complex data requiring tailored statistical analysis methods. Detailed protocols have been published for data acquisition by liquid NMR, solid-state NMR, ultra-performance liquid chromatography (LC-)MS and gas chromatography (GC-)MS on biofluids or tissues and their preprocessing. Here we propose an efficient protocol (guidelines and software) for statistical analysis of metabolic data generated by these methods. Code for all steps is provided, and no prior coding skill is necessary. We offer efficient solutions for the different steps required within the complete phenotyping data analytics workflow: scaling, normalization, outlier detection, multivariate analysis to explore and model study-related effects, selection of candidate biomarkers, validation, multiple testing correction and performance evaluation of statistical models. We also provide a statistical power calculation algorithm and safeguards to ensure robust and meaningful experimental designs that deliver reliable results. We exemplify the protocol with a two-group classification study and data from an epidemiological cohort; however, the protocol can be easily modified to cover a wider range of experimental designs or incorporate different modeling approaches. This protocol describes a minimal set of analyses needed to rigorously investigate typical datasets encountered in metabolic phenotyping.},

	abstract = {Assigning functions to every gene in a living organism is the next challenge for functional genomics. In fact, 85{\textendash}90\% of the 19,000 genes of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans genome do not produce any visible phenotype when inactivated, which hampers determining their function, especially when they do not belong to previously characterized gene families. We used 1H high-resolution magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy (1H HRMAS-NMR) to reveal the latent phenotype associated to superoxide dismutase (sod-1) and catalase (ctl-1) C. elegans mutations, both involved in the elimination of radical oxidative species. These two silent mutations are significantly discriminated from the wild-type strain and from each other. We identify a metabotype significantly associated with these mutations involving a general reduction of fatty acyl resonances from triglycerides, unsaturated lipids being known targets of free radicals. This work opens up perspectives for the use of 1H HRMAS-NMR as a molecular phenotyping device for model organisms. Because it is amenable to high throughput and is shown to be highly informative, this approach may rapidly lead to a functional and integrated metabonomic mapping of the C. elegans genome at the systems biology level.},

abstract = { This study had the dual purpose of applying vibrational spectroscopy to measure marzipan composition and of comparing a number of infrared and near infrared (NIR) set-ups and sampling techniques. A set of 32 marzipan samples of nine different recipes were analysed chemically and measured on six different spectrometer set-ups. Calibrations were developed using partial least squares regression (PLSR) to moisture and sugar content. Interval PLS (iPLS) was applied to all the recorded data sets to find optimal spectral intervals (of 100 nm) for the calibrations. The root mean square error of cross-validation (RMSECV) for the prediction of the moisture was found to be 0.36\% w/w moisture (range 7-19\%). The sugar content was predicted with a RMSECV of 1.43\%w/w(range 33-68\%). Despite large variations in spectral range, instrumental design and sampling devices the different NIR spectrometer set-ups yielded calibration results with only small differences. The results are discussed in terms of the robustness of NIR instrumentation for rapid non-destructive food analysis and underline the holistic information provided in the NIR spectral range. }

abstract  = {Substantial refractive index mismatches between substrate and layers lead to undulating baselines, which are known as interference fringes. These fringes can be attributed to multiple reflections inside the layers. For thin and plane parallel layers, these multiple reflections result in wave interference and electric field intensities which strongly depend on the location within the layer and wavenumber. In particular, the average electric field intensity is increased in spectral regions where the reflectance is reduced. Therefore, the most important precondition for the Beer-Lambert law to hold, absorption as the single reason for electric field intensity changes, is no longer valid and, since absorption is proportional to the electric field intensity, considerable deviations from the Beer-Lambert law result. Fringe removal is consequently synonymous with correcting deviations from the Beer-Lambert law in the spectra. Within this contribution, we introduce an appropriate formalism based on wave optics, which allows a particularly fast and simple correction of any interference based effects. We applied our approach for correcting transmittance spectra of Poly(methyl methacrylate) layers on silicon substrates. The interference effects were successfully removed and correct baselines, in good agreement with the calculated spectra, were obtained. Due to its sound theoretical foundation, our formalism can be used as benchmark to test the performance of other methods for interference fringe removal.}

abstract = {Raman spectroscopy as a technique has high potential for biological applications, e.g. cell and tissue analysis. In these applications, large data sets are normally recorded which require automated analysis. Unfortunately, a lot of disturbing external influences exist, which negatively affect the analysis of Raman spectra. A problematic corrupting effect in big data sets is cosmic ray noise, which usually produces intense spikes within the Raman spectra. In order to exploit Raman spectroscopy in real world applications, detection and removing of spikes should be stable, data-independent and performed without manual control. Herein, an automatic algorithm for cosmic ray noise correction is presented. The algorithm distinguishes spikes from spectra based on their response to a Laplacian, e.g. their sharpness. Manual rating of the spike presence was used as a benchmark for algorithm validation. The algorithm's sensitivity was estimated to be above 99\%.}

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on the op amp noise theory and applications. Noise for audio op amps is specified with a graph of equivalent input noise versus frequency. These graphs usually show two distinct regions: lower frequencies where pink noise is the dominant effect and higher frequencies where white noise is the dominant effect. Actual measurements for the TLV2772 show that the noise has both white and pink characteristics. Therefore, the noise equations for each type of noise cannot approximate the total noise out of the TLV2772 over the entire range shown on the graph. It is necessary to break the noise into two parts-the pink part and the white part-then add those parts together to get the total op amp noise using the root mean square law. Additionally, Texas Instruments measures the noise characteristics of a large sampling of devices. This information is compiled and used to determine the typical noise performance of the device. These noise specifications refer the input noise of the op amp. Some noise portions can be represented better by a voltage source and some by a current source. Input voltage noise is always represented by a voltage source in series with the noninverting input. Input current noise is always represented by current sources from both inputs to ground.}
