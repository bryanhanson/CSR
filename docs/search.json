Version control means everyone can see every stupid mistake I’ve ever made.”\n– Karl Broman\n\nThe purpose of this blog is to provide a place to share my work in the area of Chemometrics & Spectroscopy using FOSS (free and open source) tools. Mostly I work with R but I use other tools as needed. Some areas I expect to write about from time-to-time include:\nMajor updates to R packages I author See here\nTutorials on how to accomplish certain tasks, generally inspired by user questions.\nDevelopments in the chemometrics and spectroscopy community.\nOccasionally, discussion of interesting papers.\nAbout Your Host\nYou can reach me at hanson@depauw.edu. Occasionally I am on Twitter.\nNow\nI am currently a freelance R consultant with expertise in:\nDevelopment of R packages supporting science, especially spectroscopy and chemometrics\nSpectroscopy (NMR, IR, UV-Vis etc)\nChemometrics\nExploratory Data Analysis\nData Visualizations\nData Management: organization, cleaning\nReproducible Research: the automated writing of research reports\nR Training\nWeb page creation and maintenance\nFamiliar with R, markdown, LaTeX, html, css, JavaScript\nResume\nThen\nI retired in June 2018 from DePauw University after 32 years of teaching chemistry and biochemistry. It was a good run. No regrets. Just time to do something else.\nKarl Broman quote source\n\n\n\n",

However, it is no longer being updated, as I retired in June 2018.\nIn my group, we conduct research on how plants respond to the stress of climate change. Such stress can take the form of too much heat, too much salt in the soil, or too little water. We use methods from metabolomics, chemistry and ecology, and benefit from collaboration with Prof. Dana Dudle in the Biology Department. We greatly appreciate support from DePauw’s Science Research Fellows program (now discontinued), the Faculty Development Committee, and the Mellon Foundation (through FDC).\nOur plant of choice is Portulaca oleracea, a weed more commonly known as purslane. We have chosen purslane because it is easy to grow and is interesting from a medicinal/nutritional perspective - it has the most omega-3 fatty acids of any plant. Our original objective was to determine whether purslane’s response to stress has a genetic component which also contributes to reproductive fitness. We have been able to confirm this, and we are now focussed on understanding the molecular nature of purslane’s response: What pathways are activated? What molecules are involved?\nOur approach is to blend metabolomic and ecological methods. Metabolomics is the study of an organism’s metabolites under a controlled set of conditions, in our case, normal versus stressful conditions. As far as possible, one tries to measure all the metabolites at once, in a holistic fashion, which is not an easy feat. Typically, this is done with NMR, MS, IR, or other forms of spectroscopy. We also supplement these instrumental techniques with more traditional single point chemical measurements such as antioxidant levels. From the ecological perspective, we record parameters of plant growth that represent measures of fitness, such as biomass produced, the number of flowers, and so forth. To be meaningful, we need to conduct these experiments on large numbers of plants. The resulting data sets, composed of very different sorts of measurements, represent the state of the plant under the conditions tested. We use various statistical methods to figure out which treatments have produced an interesting response, and whether those responses vary with genotype. Our statistical analyses are done with the open source computational statistical program R and in the case of spectroscopic data, with the ChemoSpec package for R, written by Bryan.\n\nThe following students have carried out this research.
