Version\ncontrol means everyone can see every stupid mistake I’ve ever made.”\n– Karl Broman\n\nThe purpose of this blog is to provide a place to share my work in\nthe area of Chemometrics & Spectroscopy using FOSS (free and open\nsource) tools. Mostly I work with R but I use other tools\nas needed. Some areas I expect to write about from time-to-time\ninclude:\nMajor updates to R packages I author See here\nTutorials on how to accomplish certain tasks, generally inspired by\nuser questions.\nDevelopments in the chemometrics and spectroscopy community.\nOccasionally, discussion of interesting papers.\nAbout Your Host\nYou can reach me at\nhanson@depauw.edu. Occasionally I\nam on Twitter.\nNow\nI am currently a freelance R consultant with expertise\nin:\nDevelopment of R packages supporting science,\nespecially spectroscopy and chemometrics\nSpectroscopy (NMR, IR, UV-Vis etc)\nChemometrics\nExploratory Data Analysis\nData Visualizations\nData Management: organization, cleaning\nReproducible Research: the automated writing of research\nreports\nR Training\nWeb page creation and maintenance\nFamiliar with R, markdown, LaTeX, html, css,\nJavaScript\nResume\nThen\nI retired in June 2018 from DePauw University after 32 years of\nteaching chemistry and biochemistry. It was a good run. No regrets. Just\ntime to do something else.\nKarl\nBroman quote source\n\n\n\n",

Such stress can take the form of too much heat, too\nmuch salt in the soil, or too little water. We use methods from\nmetabolomics, chemistry and ecology, and benefit from collaboration with\nProf. Dana Dudle in the Biology Department. We greatly appreciate\nsupport from DePauw’s Science Research Fellows program (now\ndiscontinued), the Faculty Development Committee, and the Mellon\nFoundation (through FDC).\nOur plant of choice is Portulaca oleracea, a weed more\ncommonly known as purslane. We have chosen purslane because it is easy\nto grow and is interesting from a medicinal/nutritional perspective - it\nhas the most omega-3 fatty acids of any plant. Our original objective\nwas to determine whether purslane’s response to stress has a genetic\ncomponent which also contributes to reproductive fitness. We have been\nable to confirm this, and we are now focussed on understanding the\nmolecular nature of purslane’s response: What pathways are activated?\nWhat molecules are involved?\nOur approach is to blend metabolomic and ecological methods.\nMetabolomics is the study of an organism’s metabolites under a\ncontrolled set of conditions, in our case, normal versus stressful\nconditions. As far as possible, one tries to measure all the metabolites\nat once, in a holistic fashion, which is not an easy feat. Typically,\nthis is done with NMR, MS, IR, or other forms of spectroscopy. We also\nsupplement these instrumental techniques with more traditional single\npoint chemical measurements such as antioxidant levels. From the\necological perspective, we record parameters of plant growth that\nrepresent measures of fitness, such as biomass produced, the number of\nflowers, and so forth. To be meaningful, we need to conduct these\nexperiments on large numbers of plants. The resulting data sets,\ncomposed of very different sorts of measurements, represent the state of\nthe plant under the conditions tested. We use various statistical\nmethods to figure out which treatments have produced an interesting\nresponse, and whether those responses vary with genotype. Our\nstatistical analyses are done with the open source computational\nstatistical program R and in the\ncase of spectroscopic data, with the ChemoSpec\npackage for R, written by Bryan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following students have carried out this research.
