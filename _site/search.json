Version control means everyone can see every stupid mistake I’ve ever made.”\n– Karl Broman\n\nThe purpose of this blog is to provide a place to share my work in the area of Chemometrics & Spectroscopy using FOSS (free and open source) tools. Mostly I work with R but I use other tools as needed. Some areas I expect to write about from time-to-time include:\nMajor updates to R packages I author See here\nTutorials on how to accomplish certain tasks, generally inspired by user questions.\nDevelopments in the chemometrics and spectroscopy community.\nOccasionally, discussion of interesting papers.\nAbout Your Host\nYou can reach me at hanson@depauw.edu. Occasionally I am on Twitter.\nNow\nI am currently a freelance R consultant with expertise in:\nDevelopment of R packages supporting science, especially spectroscopy and chemometrics\nSpectroscopy (NMR, IR, UV-Vis etc)\nChemometrics\nExploratory Data Analysis\nData Visualizations\nData Management: organization, cleaning\nReproducible Research: the automated writing of research reports\nR Training\nWeb page creation and maintenance\nFamiliar with R, markdown, LaTeX, html, css, JavaScript\nResume\nThen\nI retired in June 2018 from DePauw University after 32 years of teaching chemistry and biochemistry. It was a good run. No regrets. Just time to do something else.\nKarl Broman quote source\n\n\n\n",
