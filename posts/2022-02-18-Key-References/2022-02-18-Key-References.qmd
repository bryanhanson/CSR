Jerome Workman Jr. and Howard Mark have published a very useful series of articles in [Spectroscopy Online](https://www.spectroscopyonline.com), summarizing common chemometric methods in spectroscopy, and giving the key publications on each.  These are a great resource if one is learning about a technique, or if one wants to check out the fundamentals of a method you think you already know.  Posting here for convenience!
