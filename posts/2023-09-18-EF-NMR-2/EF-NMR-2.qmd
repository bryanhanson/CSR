I have been studying Earth's Field NMR for a bit now.  The other day I came across a paper that clued me into some additional interesting features of EF-NMR I was not aware of.

As all organic chemists know, in NMR we use the $n + 1$ rule to determine splitting, and Pascal's triangle as a nemonic to remember the relative areas of the peaks within a multiplet.  For instance, we expect that the $\ce{CH3}$ group in ethanol to be a triplet with areas 1:2:1, due to the $\ce{CH3}$ group having two proton neighbors in the $\ce{CH2}$ group.  We treat the two protons in $\ce{CH2}$ as magnetically equivalent.

## J-Coupled Specta

The $n+1$ rule works at typical fields used for structural determination, let's say 60 MHz and above.[^1]  At these fields one is working in the so-called "weak coupling" region. However, as one lowers the field to really low values, one encounters the "strong coupling" region, where one observes "J-coupled-spectra" or JCS. Under strong coupling, the $\ce{CH2}$ protons in ethanol are no longer magnetically equivalent, and each of them couples differently to other nuclei, and the $n + 1$ rule breaks down.

The strict requirement for JCS is that there be two or more protons attached to a spin $\frac{1}{2}$ heteroatom and the magnetic field be quite small.  For a simple system, let's say $\ce{H_i\bond{-}X\bond{-} H_j}$, the strict requirement to see separate lines for the no-longer-equivalent protons is:

$$
\lvert J_{XH_i} - J_{XH_j} \rvert \ge \lvert J_{H_{i}H_{j}} \rvert
$$

If this seems a bit strange, well, 1) it is, and 2) it has always been the case that the "equivalent" protons in for example a $\ce{CH2}$ group do couple, we just don't normally see it or worry about it.[^2]

## How Small is Small?

How small does the magnetic field have to be for J-coupled spectra to appear? This is covered in detail in @Appelt2010 but generally speaking JCS appear at around $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-4}$ Tesla.[^3]  The magnetic field of earth is around 50 mT, right in the sweet spot. The Larmor resonance frequency for $\ce{^{1}H}$ at this field strength is around 2 kHz.

## What Replaces the $n + 1$ Rule?

In the case of a system like $\ce{X\bond{-}H_N}$, the number of lines that will be observed is

$$
\textrm{no. of lines} = 2 \sum_{n = 1, n \in U}^{N}N - n + 1
$$

Where $U$ is the set of odd numbers (for odd $N$, one evaluates until $N -n = 0$; for even $N$, evaluate until $N-n=1$).  The leading multiplier of 2 accounts for the doublet due to $\ce{J_{XH}}$.  This formula doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.  We can evaluate it to get the first few terms:

```{r}
N <- 5L # evaluate 1:N terms
no.lines <- rep(NA_integer_, N) # initialize storage
for (i in 1:N) {
  odd <- (1:i) %% 2
  n <- (1:i)[as.logical(odd)] # get odd n no larger than N
  no.lines[i] <- sum(i - n + 1) # take advantage of R's vectorization
}
names(no.lines) <- paste("N=", 1:N, sep = "") # pretty it up
no.lines <- no.lines * 2 # account for J_HX
no.lines
```

## Examples

A couple of examples should clarify the situation.  All of these will be from the perspective of observing  $\ce{^{1}H}$.[^4]  These examples are taken from @Appelt2007.

### $\ce{PH2}$

At *high field* the $\ce{^{1}H}$ spectrum of $\ce{PH2}$ would be a symmetric doublet with a peak separation of $\ce{J_{PH}}$.

In *earth's field*, the spectrum is first split into a doublet by $\ce{J_{PH}}$, but the spacing is not symmetric.  Then, each part of the doublet is split further into two peaks, also asymmetrically and with varying linewidths.  @fig-PH2 shows how the splitting changes as a function of field strength.  Note that in the strong coupling region there are four peaks, as predicted above.

### $\ce{CH3OH}$

For the case of methanol in Earth's field, the spectrum is first asymmetrically split by the $\ce{^{13}C}$ with spacing $\ce{J_{CH}}$.  Then each part of the doublet is further split into four peaks. @fig-methanol shows the EF spectrum of methanol.  The asymmetry of the line spacing and line widths is apparent.

### Further Reading

For a broad overview of this topic, take a look at @Kaseman2020; for a detailed walk-through of the theory with many more examples, see @Appelt2007, and other papers by Appelt et al.  Be prepared to spend some time with these papers.

[^1]: 60 MHz chosen simply because commercial instruments have been available at that field *for forever*.
[^2]: The protons in something like $\ce{CH2Cl2}$ actually do couple to each other.  With [a little trick](http://u-of-o-nmr-facility.blogspot.com/2008/06/spin-spin-coupling-between-equivalent.html?m=1), you can measure $J_{HH}$.
[^3]: This is a general trend.  The exact boundaries between various coupling regimes depends on the nuclei involved, the coupling constants and the peak separation in Larmor frequency (in Hz).  
[^4]: Remember, signals are very weak at EF so observing heteronuclei is significantly more challenging.  See the [previous post](https://chemospec.org/posts/2023-07-19-EF-NMR-1/EF-NMR-1.html) for details.
