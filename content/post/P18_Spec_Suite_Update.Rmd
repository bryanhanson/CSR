My suite of spectroscopy `R` packages has been updated on CRAN.  There are only a few small changes, but they will be important to some of you:

* `ChemoSpecUtils` now provides a set of colorblind-friendly colors, see `?colorSymbol`.  These are available for use in `ChemoSpec` and `ChemoSpec2D`.
* At the request of several folks, `readJDX` now includes a function, [`splitMultiblockDX`](https://rdrr.io/cran/readJDX/man/splitMultiblockDX.html), that will split a multiblock JCAMP-DX file into separate files, which can then be imported via the usual functions in the package.
* All packages are built against the upcoming R 4.1 release (due in April).

Here are the links to the documentation:

* [`ChemoSpec`](https://bryanhanson.github.io/ChemoSpec/)
* [`ChemSpec2D`](https://bryanhanson.github.io/ChemoSpec2D/)
* [`ChemoSpecUtils`](https://rdrr.io/cran/ChemoSpecUtils/)
* [`readJDX`](https://rdrr.io/cran/readJDX/)

As always, let me know if you discover trouble or have questions.
