<p>For this inaugural blog post, I’m pleased to share a project I have been working on recently: <a href="https://bryanhanson.github.io/FOSS4Spectroscopy/">FOSS4Spectroscopy</a> is an attempt to catalog FOSS spectroscopy software. The page is designed to be updated easily with new or edited entries – see the page for details, and please contribute!</p>
<p>For this initial version, I searched the CRAN ecosystem via <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=packagefinder">packagefinder</a> and the <code>Python</code> world via <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPi.org</a> using spectroscopy-related keywords. My expertise is in <code>R</code> so I’m pretty confident I have most of the <code>R</code> packages included. I’m not so confident about coverage of the <code>Python</code> packages (where else should I look?).</p>
<p>Currently, the “status” column in the main table is empty. I am working on a version which will update the status with a date giving some indication of the age and activity of the repository. Right now the page is updated when I push to Github, but in the long run I hope to get Travis-CI to run it as a weekly cron job.</p>
<p>I welcome your feedback in any form!</p>
