<p><a href="https://bryanhanson.github.io/ChemoSpec/"><code>ChemoSpec</code></a> has just been updated to version 5.2.12, and should be available on the mirrors shortly.</p>
<p>The most significant user-facing changes are actually in the update to <code>ChemoSpecUtils</code> from a <a href="https://chemospec.org/2020/01/22/p4/">few days ago</a>. In addition, the following documentation changes were made:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added documentation for <code>updateGroups</code> which has been in <code>ChemoSpecUtils</code> for a while but effectively hidden from users of <code>ChemoSpec</code>.</li>
<li>Fixed the example in <code>mclustSpectra</code> which had an error and used data that was not a good illustration.</li>
</ul>
