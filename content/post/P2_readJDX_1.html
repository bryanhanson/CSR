<p><code>readJDX</code> reads files in the <a href="http://www.jcamp-dx.org/">JCAMP-DX</a> format used in the field of spectroscopy. A recent overhaul has made it much more robust, and as such the version is now at 0.4.29.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Most of the changes were internal, but three important user-facing changes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>improved documentation</li>
<li>the addition of more vignettes</li>
<li>improved output when <code>debug &gt; 0</code></li>
<li>2D NMR files are now handled</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see more about the package <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=readJDX">here</a>. As always, if you use the package and have troubles, please file an <a href="https://github.com/bryanhanson/readJDX/issues">issue</a>. The JCAMP-DX standard is challenging and vendors have a lot of flexibility, so please do share any problematic files you encounter.</p>
