<p><a href="https://bryanhanson.github.io/FOSS4Spectroscopy/">FOSS for Spectroscopy</a> has had a significant update! It’s really quite surprising how many projects are out there. There is a lot of variety and not too much overlap.</p>
<ul>
<li>After a lot of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/59632173/633251">wrestling</a> with Github access issues, the <code>Status</code> column in the table now gives the date of the most recent update to the project that I can find in an automated way.</li>
<li>The <code>Notes</code> column is now called <code>Focus</code> and reflects the focus of the projects as far as I can determine things. I’m using a more-or-less controlled vocabulary here, so sorting on the <code>Focus</code> column should bring related projects together.</li>
<li>The number of entries is greatly expanded (and I have more in the hopper).</li>
<li>The page is now automatically updated weekly, which will keep the links and dates fresh.</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, I welcome your feedback in any form. You can use the comments below, or if you have additions/corrections to the page itself, there is info there about how to submit updates.</p>
