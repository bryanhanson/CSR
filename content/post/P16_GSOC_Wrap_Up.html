Well, things have been busy lately! As reported back in <a href="https://chemospec.org/2020/05/07/p14/"><em>May</em></a>, I’ve been participating in Google Summer of Code which has now wrapped up. This was very rewarding for me, but today I want to share a guest post by Erick Oduniyi, the very talented student on the project. Bryan

<p>Checking in from Kansas!</p>
<p>This past summer (2020) I had the amazing opportunity to participate in the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a> (GSoC or GSOC). As stated on the the GSOC website, GSOC is a “global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development. Students work with an open-source organization on a 3-month programming project during their break from school.”</p>
<p>This was a particularly meaningful experience as it was my last undergraduate summer internship. I’m a senior studying computer engineering at the University of Kansas, and at the beginning of the summer I still didn’t feel super comfortable working on public (open-source) projects. So, I thought this program would help build my confidence as a computer and software engineer. Moreover:</p>
<ul>
<li>I wanted to work with the <code>R</code> organization because that is my favorite programming language.</li>
<li>I wanted to work with <code>r-hyperspec</code> because I thought that would be the most impactful in terms of practicing project management and software ecosystem development.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the process I hoped to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Become proficient using <code>Git/Github</code>, including continuous integration</li>
<li>Become proficient in using <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a></li>
<li>Become proficient in using <code>R</code></li>
<li>Become familiar with the spectroscopy community</li>
<li>Become inspired to code more</li>
<li>Become inspired to document and write more open source projects.</li>
<li>Become excited to collaborate more across various industrial, academic, and community domains.</li>
</ul>
<p>And through a lot of hard work all of those things came to be! Truthfully, even though the summer project was successful there is still a lot of work to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fortify <code>hyperSpec</code> for <code>baseline</code> with bridge packages</li>
<li>Fortify <code>hyperSpec</code> for <code>EMSC</code> with bridge packages</li>
<li>Fortify <code>hyperSpec</code> for <code>matrixStats</code> with bridge packages.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, I’m excited to continue to work with the team! I think there are a ton of ideas I and the team have and hopefully we will get to explore them in deeper context. Speaking of the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/r-hyperspec/teams/r-hyperspec/members">team</a>, I have them to thank for an awesome <code>GSOC 2020</code> experience. If you are interested in the journey that was the GSoC 2020 experience (perhaps you might be interested in trying the program next year), then please feel free to jump around <a href="https://eoduniyi.github.io/hyperSpec.gsoc2020/">here</a> to get a feel for the things that I learned and how I worked with the <code>r-hyperspec</code> team this summer.</p>
<p>Best, E. Oduniyi</p>
