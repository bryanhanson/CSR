<p>I’m really happy to announce that this summer I’ll be a co-mentor on two <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a> spectroscopy projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once again, I’ll co-mentor with Claudia and Vilmantas to continue the work Erick started last summer on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hyperSpec/index.html"><code>hyperSpec</code></a> (see <a href="https://chemospec.org/2020/09/08/p16/">here</a> for Erick’s wrap up blog post at the end of last year). <a href="https://github.com/sangttruong">Sang Truong</a> is the very talented student who will be joining us. Sang’s project is described <a href="https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2021/wiki/hyperSpec">here</a>.</li>
<li>New this year: <a href="https://bryanhanson.github.io/ChemoSpec/"><code>ChemoSpec</code></a> will be upgraded to use <code>ggplot2</code> graphics along with interactive graphics for many of the plots that are currently rendered in <a href="https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2021/wiki/Interactive-Graphics-for-ChemoSpec">base graphics</a>. Erick, who was the student working on <code>hyperSpec</code> last summer, will be my co-mentor on this project. We are looking forward to having <a href="https://github.com/Tejasvigupta">Tejasvi Gupta</a> as the student on this project.</li>
</ul>
