<p>This is Part 3 of a series on aligning 2D NMR, as implemented in the package <code>ChemoSpec2D</code>. <a href="https://chemospec.org/2020/02/20/p8/">Part 1</a>. <a href="https://chemospec.org/2020/02/20/p8/">Part 2</a>.</p>

<h2>hats_alignSpectra2D</h2>
<p>Let’s get to work. The function is <code>hats_alignSpectra2D</code>. The arguments <code>maxF1</code> and <code>maxF2</code> define the space that will be considered as the two spectra are shifted relative to each other. The space potentially covered is <code>-maxF1</code> to <code>maxF1</code> and similarly for the F2 dimension. <code>dist_method</code>, <code>thres</code> and <code>minimize</code> refer to the objective function, as described in Part 1. In this example we will consider two spectra succcessfully aligned when we get below the threshold. When one shifts one spectrum relative to the other, part of the shifted spectrum gets cutoff and part of it is empty space. <code>fill = "noise"</code> instructs the function to fill the empty space with an estimate of the noise from the original spectrum. We’ll set <code>plot = FALSE</code> here because the output is extensive. I’ll provide sample plotting output in a moment.</p>

<p>As the alignment proceeds, updates from the function are prefixed with <code>[ChemoSpec2D]</code>. In the first step we get a message that row 1 of 9 of the guide tree is being processed, in which sample 7 is being aligned with sample 4. The guide tree is shown below. One can see that samples 7 and 4 are very similar, so they are aligned first. If you inspect the output above, you can see that the four most similar pairs of spectra are aligned first, followed by groups of spectra according to similarity. For each alignment the needed shifts are reported. The last part of the output is a list of all the alignments carried out. Note that the vertical scale on the guide tree is the same as the scale on the <code>sampleDist</code> plot in Part 1.</p>

<h2>Diagnostics on Space</h2>
<p>To save space, I suppressed the plotting of the results. However, there are plots! In fact there is a set of plots for each alignment step. Here are two of the plots produced if <code>plot = TRUE</code>; these deal with the X-Space which is the search space (the terminology comes from the <code>mlrMBO</code> package which is designed to handle many types of optimization). This plot is for Step 7. The upper plot shows the search space. Axis x1 corresponds to the F1 dimension, and axis x2 the F2 dimension. The red squares represent the initial experimental design. The blue circles represent additional points added as the search proceeds. The orange diamond is the best alignment, which in this case has no shift along F2 but a three data point shift along F1; this corresponds to the output above. The green triangle is the last position tested.</p>
<p>The lower plot represents the progress of the search over time. Axis “dob” stands for “date of birth” which is basically the time index of when the test point was added.</p>

<div id="diagnostics-on-the-objective-function" class="section level2">
<h2>Diagnostics on the Objective Function</h2>
<p>This second set of plots deals with what <code>mlrMBO</code> considers the Y-Space, which concerns the values of the objective function. The top plot is a histogram of the objective function values; in this case most of them were pretty bad (high, meaning a larger distance between the spectra). The middle plot is the value of the objective function over time (dob). In this example the optimal alignment is found at dob = 4. The lower plot FINISH</p>

<p>Did this process even work? The final plot shows that it did. LETS BE CLEAR.</p>
