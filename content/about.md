## Now

I am currently a freelance `R` consultant with expertise in:

* Development of `R` packages supporting science, especially spectroscopy and chemometrics
* Spectroscopy (NMR, IR, UV-Vis etc)
* Chemometrics
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data Visualizations
* Data Management: organization, cleaning
* Reproducible Research: the automated writing of research reports
* `R` Training
* Web page creation and maintenance
* Familiar with `R`, markdown, LaTeX, html, css, JavaScript
* [Resume](/resume/)

## Then

I retired in June 2018 from DePauw University after 32 years of teaching chemistry and biochemistry.  It was a good run. No regrets.  Just time to do something else.
