The purpose of this blog is to provide a place to share my work in the area of Chemometrics & Spectroscopy using FOSS (free and open source) tools.  Mostly I work with `R` but I use other tools as needed.  Some areas I expect to write about from time-to-time include:

* Major updates to `R` packages I author [See here](/links/)
* Tutorials on how to accomplish certain tasks, generally inspired by user questions.
* Developments in the chemometrics and spectroscopy community.
* Occasionally, discussion of interesting papers.
