I'm really happy to announce that this summer I'll be a co-mentor on two [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) spectroscopy projects:

* Once again, I'll co-mentor with Claudia and Vilmantas to continue the work Erick started last summer on [`hyperSpec`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hyperSpec/index.html) (see [here](https://chemospec.org/2020/09/08/p16/) for Erick's wrap up blog post at the end of last year).  [Sang Truong](https://github.com/sangttruong) is the very talented student who will be joining us.  Sang's project is described [here](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2021/wiki/hyperSpec).
* New this year: [`ChemoSpec`](https://bryanhanson.github.io/ChemoSpec/) will be upgraded to use `ggplot2` graphics along with interactive graphics for many of the plots that are currently rendered in [base graphics](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2021/wiki/Interactive-Graphics-for-ChemoSpec).  Erick, who was the student working on `hyperSpec` last summer, will be my co-mentor on this project.  We are looking forward to having [Tejasvi Gupta](https://github.com/Tejasvigupta) as the student on this project.
