`readJDX` reads files in the [JCAMP-DX](http://www.jcamp-dx.org/) format used in the field of spectroscopy.  A recent overhaul has made it much more robust, and as such the version is now at 0.4.29.[^1]  Most of the changes were internal, but three important user-facing changes are:

* improved documentation
* the addition of more vignettes
* improved output when `debug > 0`
* 2D NMR files are now handled

You can see more about the package [here](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=readJDX).  As always, if you use the package and have troubles, please file an [issue](https://github.com/bryanhanson/readJDX/issues).  The JCAMP-DX standard is challenging and vendors have a lot of flexibility, so please do share any problematic files you encounter.

[^1]: The current version also includes changes in an unreleased version (0.3.372) in which several bugs were squashed.
