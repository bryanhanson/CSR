The other day I came across a paper that clued me into some additional interesting features of EF-NMR I was not aware of.\n\nAs all organic chemists know, in NMR we use the $n + 1$ rule to determine splitting, and Pascal's triangle as a nemonic to remember the relative areas of the peaks within a multiplet.  For instance, we expect that the $\\ce{CH3}$ group in ethanol to be a triplet with areas 1:2:1, due to the $\\ce{CH3}$ group having two proton neighbors in the $\\ce{CH2}$ group.  We treat the two protons in $\\ce{CH2}$ as magnetically equivalent.\n\n## J-Coupled Specta\n\nThe $n+1$ rule works at typical fields used for structural determination, let's say 60 MHz and above.[^1]  At these fields one is working in the so-called \"weak coupling\" region. However, as one lowers the field to really low values, one encounters the \"strong coupling\" region, where one observes \"J-coupled-spectra\" or JCS. Under strong coupling, the $\\ce{CH2}$ protons in ethanol are no longer magnetically equivalent, and each of them couples differently to other nuclei, and the $n + 1$ rule breaks down.\n\nThe strict requirement for JCS is that there be two or more protons attached to a spin $\\frac{1}{2}$ heteroatom and the magnetic field be quite small.  For a simple system, let's say $\\ce{H_i\\bond{-}X\\bond{-} H_j}$, the strict requirement to see separate lines for the no-longer-equivalent protons is:\n\n$$\n\\lvert J_{XH_i} - J_{XH_j} \\rvert \\ge \\lvert J_{H_{i}H_{j}} \\rvert\n$$\n\nIf this seems a bit strange, well, 1) it is, and 2) it has always been the case that the \"equivalent\" protons in for example a $\\ce{CH2}$ group do couple, we just don't normally see it or worry about it.[^2]\n\n## How Small is Small?\n\nHow small does the magnetic field have to be for J-coupled spectra to appear? This is covered in detail in @Appelt2010 but generally speaking JCS appear at around $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-4}$ Tesla.[^3]  The magnetic field of earth is around 50 mT, right in the sweet spot. The Larmor resonance frequency for $\\ce{^{1}H}$ at this field strength is around 2 kHz.\n\n## What Replaces the $n + 1$ Rule?\n\nIn the case of a system like $\\ce{X\\bond{-}H_N}$, the number of lines that will be observed is\n\n$$\n\\textrm{no. of lines} = 2 \\sum_{n = 1, n \\in U}^{N}N - n + 1\n$$\n\nWhere $U$ is the set of odd numbers (for odd $N$, one evaluates until $N -n = 0$; for even $N$, evaluate until $N-n=1$).  The leading multiplier of 2 accounts for the doublet due to $\\ce{J_{XH}}$.  This formula doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.  We can evaluate it to get the first few terms:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nN <- 5L # evaluate 1:N terms\nno.lines <- rep(NA_integer_, N) # initialize storage\nfor (i in 1:N) {\n  odd <- (1:i) %% 2\n  n <- (1:i)[as.logical(odd)] # get odd n no larger than N\n  no.lines[i] <- sum(i - n + 1) # take advantage of R's vectorization\n}\nnames(no.lines) <- paste(\"N=\", 1:N, sep = \"\") # pretty it up\nno.lines <- no.lines * 2 # account for J_HX\nno.lines\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nN=1 N=2 N=3 N=4 N=5 \n  2   4   8  12  18 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Examples\n\nA couple of examples should clarify the situation.  All of these will be from the perspective of observing  $\\ce{^{1}H}$.[^4]  These examples are taken from @Appelt2007.\n\n### $\\ce{PH2}$\n\nAt *high field* the $\\ce{^{1}H}$ spectrum of $\\ce{PH2}$ would be a symmetric doublet with a peak separation of $\\ce{J_{PH}}$.\n\nIn *earth's field*, the spectrum is first split into a doublet by $\\ce{J_{PH}}$, but the spacing is not symmetric.  Then, each part of the doublet is split further into two peaks, also asymmetrically and with varying linewidths.  @fig-PH2 shows how the splitting changes as a function of field strength.  Note that in the strong coupling region there are four peaks, as predicted above.\n\n![Figure 4 from @Appelt2007, showing the field dependence of the $\\ce{PH2}$ spectrum. ](Appelt2007Fig4.png){#fig-PH2 fig-alt=\"Appelt 2007 Fig. 4\"}\n\n### $\\ce{CH3OH}$\n\nFor the case of methanol in Earth's field, the spectrum is first asymmetrically split by the $\\ce{^{13}C}$ with spacing $\\ce{J_{CH}}$.  Then each part of the doublet is further split into four peaks. @fig-methanol shows the EF spectrum of methanol.  The asymmetry of the line spacing and line widths is apparent.\n\n![Figure 5 from @Appelt2007, showing the spectrum of methanol. ](Appelt2007Fig5.png){#fig-methanol fig-alt=\"Appelt 2007 Fig. 5\"}\n\n\n### Further Reading\n\nFor a broad overview of this topic, take a look at @Kaseman2020; for a detailed walk-through of the theory with many more examples, see @Appelt2007, and other papers by Appelt et al.  Be prepared to spend some time with these papers.\n\n[^1]: 60 MHz chosen simply because commercial instruments have been available at that field *for forever*.\n[^2]: The protons in something like $\\ce{CH2Cl2}$ actually do couple to each other.  With [a little trick](http://u-of-o-nmr-facility.blogspot.com/2008/06/spin-spin-coupling-between-equivalent.html?m=1), you can measure $J_{HH}$.\n[^3]: This is a general trend.  The exact boundaries between various coupling regimes depends on the nuclei involved, the coupling constants and the peak separation in Larmor frequency (in Hz).  \n[^4]: Remember, signals are very weak at EF so observing heteronuclei is significantly more challenging.
